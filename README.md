## Problem: Location of point in two-dimensional space
We are given a region with a polygonal y-monotonic subdivision. We want to specify which element of subdivision contains any point we choose (within the subdivision).

## Algorithm
Metod of separators.

## How to use?

### 1. Create polygon


### 2. Add edges


### 3. Chose your point


### 4. Start algorithm


### 5. See results
